Empanada Dough
==============

This is also a great alternative to struggling with French pie crust for a quick pie that you don't want to fuss with.

Plus, this recipe also makes great empanadas.



125g flour

5g salt

100g butter



Mix flour, salt and butter freely with a powered mixer until the butter is broken into pea sized pieces.



Add 1/3 cup boiling water, mix just enough to form a cohesive dough.

Press into a pie pan while warm and very pliable if youâ€™re in a hurry.

If not, let cool to room temperature and roll flat to make empanadas or rolled pie dough.
