Empanada Dough
==============

This is also a great alternative to struggling with French pie crust for a quick pie that you don't want to fuss with.

Plus, this recipe also makes great empanadas.



125g flour

5g salt

100g butter

80ml water, boiling



Mix flour, salt and butter freely with a powered mixer until the butter is broken into pea sized pieces.



Add the boiling water and mix just enough to form a cohesive dough.



Press into a pie pan while warm and very pliable if youâ€™re in a hurry.



If not, let cool to room temperature and roll flat to make empanadas or rolled pie dough. The dough can be re-rolled with little change, as the starches in the dough are partly gelatinized and the gluten is partly inactivated.
