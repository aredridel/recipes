Empanada Dough (and an alternative to struggling with French pie crust)

Plus, this recipe also makes great empanadas.

1 cup flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 stick butter

Mix freely with a powered mixer, or at least until the butter is broken into pea sized pieces

Add 1/3 cup boiling water, mix just enough to form a cohesive dough.

Press into a pie pan while warm and very pliable if youâ€™re in a hurry.

If not, let cool to room temperature and roll flat to make empanadas or rolled pie dough.
