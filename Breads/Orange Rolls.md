# Orange Rolls

Makes two 20 cm by 20 cm (8 inch) pans of rolls.

Mix

- 500 ml water
- 70 g molasses
- 10 g salt
- 150 g whole wheat flour
- zest of 2 oranges, chopped fine
- ginger
- cinnamon
- nutmeg
- clove

Tangzhong — whisk the ingredients and boil until thickened, stirring frequently. It will make a thick paste. Let it cool. It will smell amazing and make everyone wonder what you're making. The orange zest gets a bit of time to soften here too as a bonus. My preference for the spices is to add just a touch of each except clove, which complements the orange nicely.

Separately, mix

- 150 ml warm water
- 5 g sugar
- 5 g yeast

to activate the yeast in warm water. Skip activating and just mix if you're using instant yeast.

Combine the above in the mixer bowl and add

- 100 g whole wheat flour
- 400 g strong bread flour

Mix for 8-10 minutes. I use my KitchenAid mixer's speed 2. It will be a sticky dough, and not pull away from the sides of the bowl cleanly. 

Bulk ferment for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Knead briefly on a floured surface. Let rest for five minutes to let the gluten relax.

Roll half out into an approximately 18 cm (or 9 inch, an easily divisible number) wide sheet, as long as you can make it on a floured work surface or parchment, squaring the ends as best you can so it will make an even roll.

- 75 g brown sugar

Coat the sheet with brown sugar and roll tightly. Cut the log in thirds, then thirds again. 

Put 3 g slices of butter in the bottom of an 8 inch by 8 inch pan, in a 3 x 3 grid. Place a section of the log spiral side up on each slice. 

Repeat for the second half.

Refrigerate covered overnight. Let them warm and finish rising, preferably to approximately double. 

Add a thin slice of butter to the top of each roll, cover loosely with aluminum foil. 

Bake at 175 °C (350 °F) for 30-40 minutes, until the center is fully cooked. 

Remove the foil and give it just a few minutes more. Let them rest a few minutes before devouring like a pack of hungry orangutans.

## amendments to be tested

- 100g brown sugar in the center, to be actually gooey
- A bit more flour and a bit more kneading to get a higher rise.
- Apricot filling
