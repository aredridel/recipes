Mix 250cc water with 1 scant tablespoon yeast (and if active dry, a teaspoon of sugar and proof for 15 minutes).

Add 500g bread flour and 1 tablespoon of salt.

Mix wellâ€” the dough should pull away from the dough hook if using a mixer, or kneading, should develop a gluten window when stretched.

Let the dough rest for 15-60 minutes.
