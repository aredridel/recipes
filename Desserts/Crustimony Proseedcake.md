Crustimony Proseed Cake
=======================

This is my own creation, inspired by Winnie the Pooh. Eating it all is
customary procedures.

- 1C white flour
- 2/3 c whole wheat flour
- 1/2 c sugar
- 1t baking powder
- 1/2 t salt
- 1c water
- 1/3 c canola oil
- 1t vinegar
- 1t vanilla
- 1/2 cup chopped dried apricots
- 1/2 cup chopped prunes
- 2 T  sesame seeds
- 2 T poppy seeds
- 2 T sunflower seeds

Preheat oven to 350 °F.

Mix the dry ingredients, then add the remaining and mix until well blended.
Pour into a greased and floured 8 or 9 inch square pan. Bake at 350 °F for
30–40 minutes.

When the cake is done, remove it from the oven, flip it over onto a cookie
tray or other sheet, glaze it lightly with honey, and place under the
broiler until the honey caramelizes a little bit.
