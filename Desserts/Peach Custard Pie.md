Peach Custard Pie
=================

150g flour

10g sugar

4g salt





Pat-in-the-pan butter crust; put in a glass pie pan and mix with a fork:

 - 1 1/4 cups flour
 - 1 tsp sugar
 - 1/2 tsp salt
 - 1 stick very soft butter
When the butter is in smallish pieces, add:
 - 3 tbsp heavy cream
squeeze it in handfuls briefly, then pat it around the edges of the pan, making a uniform layer.

Bake at 425F for 10-15min, until lightly browned.

Mix in a separate bowl:
 - 6 tbsp butter, melted
 - 1 egg
 - 1/3 cup flour
 - 1/2 cup sugar
 - 1 tsp vanilla extract
 - 1/2 tsp salt
 (Optionally: substitute ground almonds for some of the flour, and add 1/4tsp almond extract.)

Open and drain
 - 29oz can of peaches

Arrange the peaches in the crust, then scrape the goo over them (do not spread or smooth, just dump it in the middle).
Bake at 400F for 10min, then turn the oven down to 300 and bake for 50min longer, or until lightly browned.
