Peach Custard Pie
=================

Crust
-----

150g flour

10g sugar

4g salt

100g butter

50ml cream



Preheat oven to 220 °C (425 °F)

Mix flour, sugar, salt and butter with a fork. When the butter is in small pieces, add the cream. Squeeze it in handfuls briefly, then press into a glass pie pan making a uniform layer.



Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until lightly browned.

Filling
-------

75g butter, melted

1 egg

40g flour, ground almonds plus a bit of almond flavoring is a nice amendment

100g sugar

4ml vanilla extract

4g salt

800g peaches (canned are great)



Mix the butter, egg, flour, sugar, vanilla and salt well.


Arrange the peaches in the crust, then scrape the custard filling over them (do not spread or smooth, just dump it in the middle).
Bake at 205 °C (400°F) for 10 minutes, then turn the oven down to 150 °C (300 °F) and bake for 50 minutes longer, or until lightly browned.
