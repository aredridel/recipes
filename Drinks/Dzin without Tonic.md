Dzin without Tonic
==================

This is a syrup with many of the flavors of gin. Mixed with seltzer and a squeeze of lime, it makes a virgin gin and tonic. The pith of the citrus rind adds some of the bitter flavor. Of course if you have quinine, that'd work too.

- 200g sugar
- 500ml water
- 50g whole juniper berries
- 4–5 whole allspice berries
- 8–10 whole black peppercorns
- 10g ajwain seeds
- 10g coriander seeds
- pinch of Marjoram
- 3 bay leaves
- dash of mace
- Grapefruit or lemon rind, heavy on the pith, or quinine.

Put the spices in a spice-ball or tea-ball.

Heat and simmer (not even boiling) for a couple hours. The liquid should be a mid amber. Bottle and store refrigerated.



Yields about 250ml of liquid.



Ideas I've not yet vetted but would make delicious changes to the boquet I think: Cardamom, Lavender, Rosemary, Fennel, Anise, Star Anise
