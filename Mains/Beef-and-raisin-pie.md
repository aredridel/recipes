# Beef and raisin pie

This is a full sized version of the [beef and raisin empanadas](Empanadas.md).

Make a batch of [hot water pastry](../Breads/Empanada Dough.md), which is very forgiving. Way easier than cold water pastry. Make one and a half recipes if you want a top crust.

## Beef and Raisin filling

- 450g ground beef (85% fat, or 90% fat and add a little butter or lard)
- 100g raisins and/or sultanas
- 3 cloves of garlic
- 1/2 a large onion
- 1-2g ground cloves
- 1-2g ground nutmeg
- 1-2g ground allspice
- 3g thyme
- 10g salt
- a spoonful of flour
- a splash of broth
- a bit of oil for the pan

Sautee the onions and garlic until transparent. Brown the beef in the oil, then add the salt and spices. The beef will drop a fair amount of fat, and there will be moisture left over.

Add the spoonful of flour and coat everything, stirring so the flour absorbs the water and oil and emulsifies into a gravy. I often add a splash more broth and flour since with the amount of fat in the beef I buy, it makes more gravy than the moisture in the beef can provide. It should be mostly beef, with gravy lightly coating everything and no free liquid. Let it cool.


## Assembly

Roll the dough out for a 9 inch pie pan (a 10 inch circle for the bottom crust, a 9 inch circle for the top crust if you're using one)

## Bake

Bake at 350 Â°F until lightly browned.
