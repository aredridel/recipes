# Deep Dish Savory Ricotta Pie

Preheat an oven to 400 Â°F.

Oil one [small roasting pan](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Stainless-Steel-Rectangular-Food-Trays-Barbecue-Fruit-Bread-Storage-Plate-Kitchen-Steamed-Deep-Pans-Dish-Bakeware/1005002104957403.html) well (mine is 26x20x5cm). There should be excess oil in the bottom of the pan.

 Press one [pizza dough](../Breads/Pizza-Dough.md) into the pan as best you can. Let it rise a bit while you make the rest. Gaps down the side are acceptable.

Caramelize 2 onions, zucchini, or a combination. Layer it on top of the dough.

Mix 500g ricotta cheese, 3-4 cloves of garlic chopped fine, a teaspoon of salt, and 2 large eggs. Layer it on top with a spoon and spread it all the way to the edge.

Shred 150g mozarella cheese. Sprinkle it on top.

Bake uncovered for 30-40 minutes, until the ricotta is set & the mozarella is well browned, maybe even getting crispy at the edges where it meets any oil.

Serve warm. Makes an excellent breakfast.
