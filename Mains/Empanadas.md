# Empanadas

These empanadas use a [hot water pastry](../Breads/Empanada Dough.md), which is very forgiving and can be re-rolled quite a fwe times without becoming too tough. Way easier than cold water pastry.

## Beef and Raisin filling

Uses two recipes of dough.

- 500g ground beef
- 100g raisins and/or sultanas
- 1-2g ground cloves
- 3g garlic powder
- 1-2g ground nutmeg
- 3g thyme
- 10g salt
- a spoonful of flour
- a splash of broth or water
- a bit of oil for the pan

Brown the beef in the oil, then add the salt and spices. The beef will drop a fair amount of fat, and there will be moisture left over.

Add the spoonful of flour and coat everything, stirring so the flour absorbs the water and oil and emulsifies into a gravy. I often add a splash more broth and flour since with the amount of fat in the beef I buy, it makes more gravy than thbe moisture in the beef can provide. It should be mostly beef, with gravy lightly coating everything. Let it cool.


## Egg and Artichoke filling

Uses two recipes of dough.

- 2 or 3 hard boiled eggs
- 1 can artichoke hearts (not marinated) or hearts of palm
- 5-6 sprigs of fresh dill
- a little parsley
- salt to taste
- 200g mozzarella (fior de latte) cheese


Chop the artichokes and eggs roughly.

Shred the cheese.

Finely mince the dill and parsley.

Toss until mixed.
