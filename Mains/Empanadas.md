# Empanadas

These empanadas use a [hot water pastry](../Breads/Empanada Dough.md), which is very forgiving and can be re-rolled quite a few times without becoming too tough. Way easier than cold water pastry.

## Beef and Raisin filling

Uses two recipes of dough.

- 500g ground beef
- 100g raisins and/or sultanas
- 1-2g ground cloves
- 1-2g ground nutmeg
- 1-2g ground allspice
- 3g garlic powder
- 3g thyme
- 10g salt
- a spoonful of flour
- a splash of broth or water
- a bit of oil for the pan

Brown the beef in the oil, then add the salt and spices. The beef will drop a fair amount of fat, and there will be moisture left over.

Add the spoonful of flour and coat everything, stirring so the flour absorbs the water and oil and emulsifies into a gravy. I often add a splash more broth and flour since with the amount of fat in the beef I buy, it makes more gravy than thbe moisture in the beef can provide. It should be mostly beef, with gravy lightly coating everything. Let it cool.


## Egg and Artichoke filling

Uses two recipes of dough.

- 2 or 3 hard boiled eggs
- 1 can artichoke hearts (not marinated) or hearts of palm
- 5-6 sprigs of fresh dill
- a little parsley
- salt to taste
- 200g mozzarella (fior de latte) cheese


Chop the artichokes and eggs roughly.

Shred the cheese.

Finely mince the dill and parsley.

Toss until mixed.

## Mushroom and onion empanadas

- 1 large portabello mushroom
- 1 small onion
- thyme
- salt
- a bit of flour
- oil for the pan

Chop the onion and mushroom finely. Sauteé until the onions are fully translucent and the mushrooms soft. Add a bit of flour and toss it around to absorb any moisture.



## Assembly

Roll the dough out thin (2mm thick or so) on just as much flour as needed. Cut with a large biscuit cutter or a large mug or small bowl. Save the scraps to re-roll. 

Make a different folding pattern for each kind of empanada.

### Round 

Place a circle of dough on the work surface. Put a blob of filling in the center, reaching 1cm from the edges. Put another circle on top. Crimp with a fork, and place on a non-insulated baking sheet.


### Side crimped half moons

Put a table spoon of filling or so (sized as appropriate for your dough circles) on the circle, a bit closer to one edge and not filling more than half the circle, staying 1cm away from the close edge. Starting from that edge, pick up the edge and flop it over. Counterintuitively, you start with the full edge and _roll_ the filling and dough over into place, not lifting the empty flap. Crimp with a fork and place on a non-insulated baking sheet. 

### Center-crimped purses

Place a tablespoon of filling in the center of the dough circle in an oblong blob. Lift both edges and pinch them together in the center. Starting from either end, lift and pinch together, alternating so the filling stays inside and is progressively enclosed, rather than oozing out the far side.


## Bake

Bake at 400 °F until lightly browned. Make sure the bottoms are done. If not, turn them over and bake for a few minutes more.
