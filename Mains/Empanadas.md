## Beef and Raisin filling

- 500g ground beef
- 100g raisins and/or sultanas
- 1-2g ground cloves
- 3g garlic powder
- 1-2g ground nutmeg
- 3g thyme
- 10g salt
- a spoonful of flour
- a splash of broth or water
- a bit of oil for the pan

Brown the beef in the oil, then add the salt and spices. The beef will drop a fair amount of fat, and there will be moisture left over.

Add the spoonful of flour and coat everything, stirring so the flour absorbs the water and oil and emulsifies into a gravy. I often add a splash more broth and flour since with the amount of fat in the beef I buy, it makes more gravy than thbe moisture in the beef can provide. It should be mostly beef, with gravy lightly coating everything. Let it cool.
