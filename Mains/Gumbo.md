# Gumbo

I didn't grow up eating gumbo, but I was always intrigued. There's a mystique
to it -- people get really effusive about how hard roux is to make (it's not),
it was one of those meat-filled dishes I didn't eat until much later in life,
so it was vaguely forbidden, and it was from a cuisine that wasn't quite local
to me, except that the town next to mine had a bunch of cajun folks who'd come
up from Loisiana every summer to summer in Ouray, Colorado to get away from the
heat. They brought crawfish and po boys and fritters and gumbo recipes with
them, and I wish I'd partaken more while I lived there.

I've got an [italian gumbo recipe](Italian-Gumbo.md) recipe too, but it's not
the real deal, just an analogy with a different flavor palette. Anyway, on to
the recipe, starting with the holy trinity of cajun cooking.

- 1 green pepper (I replace with carrot now since my husband is allergic.)
- 1 onion
- 3-4 stalks of celery
- parsley, ideally fresh
- 1 Andoille sausage
- 300 g chicken, chopped
- 500 g shrimp, tail off and cleaned
- 500 g okra, cut into bite-size pieces
- 1 stick of butter (125g)
- 100 g flour
- 3 litres of stock or broth, beef or chicken or vegetable
- file powder, or if not, thyme and just a little anise
- black pepper
- salt

Chop the veggies.

Cut the sausage into bite size pieces. Cut the chicken into bite size pieces.

Sweat the green pepper, onion and celery in a bit of the butter until the celery and onion are translucent or there's some browning. If you're not using powdered spices, add them here. Parsley too.

In another pan, make the roux: roughly equal amounts of butter and flour. Heat until it starts bubbling, then stir it frequently then constantly as it darkens. The only trick to making roux work and the reason it's hard? Don't burn it. Ideally you want a chestnut color, but as long as it's darker than blonde it's fine. Lighter will thicken the soup more, but darker has more flavor. Burned is a flavor I suppose but you don't want that. When it's done, _remove it from the pan so it doesn't burn_. It can go into the vegetables if your timing is good, otherwise set it aside to add shortly.

Add the broth or stock and bring it to a simmer.

Add the chicken and sausage. When it's back to a simmer, add the okra.

If you're using powdered spices, add them.

Let the soup simmer until the okra is just tender, then add the shrimp, and let it cook until the shrimp is cooked through and pink.

Adjust the salt and seasoning as you desire, and serve hot.
