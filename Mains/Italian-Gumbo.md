# Italian Gumbo 

- 500g italian sausages
- 1/4 small red cabbage
- duck fat and/or bacon fat
- broth
- pasta, in bite size pieces
- 350g frozen okra
- 1 large onion
- 1 can diced tomato
- 1 can kidney beans
- 5 cloves of garlic
- salt
- rosemary
- 40 g flour

Cook the onion in fat until starting to brown, add the garlic and cook
a little more. Add the rosemary and salt.

Cut the cabbage into small pieces and add to the pan.

Chop the sausages into bite size pieces and brown with the onions and
garlic.

Deglaze with broth, cover well, and add the can of tomatoes and the can of
beans.

Make a roux with the flour and an equal volume of fat.

Mix the roux into the soup well.

Simmar until everything is starting to get tender. Add the okra and the
pasta. Cook until the pasta is done.

## Variations to try

I want to do a completely different version, perhaps with roast potatoes,
okra, white sausages with lemon such as weisswurst or bockwurst. Perhaps
heavy on schmaltz rather than duck fat. 

I can also imagine an even stranger version: ham and shrimp, with mango
instead of tomatoes.
