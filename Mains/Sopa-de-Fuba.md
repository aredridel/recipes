Sopa de Fuba
============

Cornmeal soup is such an interesting idea!

Cut a bunch of collard greens or other hardy greens into bite size pieces.

Cut a kielbasa up into bite size pieces.

Saute√© the kielbasa until brown; add the greens and wilt them.

Add a carton of low-sodium chicken broth (this is important that it is low sodium: it is _way_ too salty with the keilbasa otherwise). Heat and simmer until the greens are soft.

In a separate pan, toast a half cup of cornmeal until it is browning and fragrant. 

Whisk the cornmeal into the soup. It should thicken into something somewhat more soup than porridge, but somewhat between them.
