- 2 lemons, 1 cut in 8ths, 1 juiced.
- 20ml olive oil
- 1 large onion, halved & sliced thin
- 4-5 garlic cloves, minced
- 5g paprika, ground

- 40g ginger, grated or minced
- 500ml broth, preferably chicken
- 2kg chicken thighs, skin removed.
- 150g green olives

## Instructions

Cut 1 lemon into 8 wedges. Juice the second. Set the wedges and juice aside. 

Saute√© the onion with salt and pepper in a skillet until starting to brown. 

Add garlic, spices, ginger and broth and bring to a boil. 

Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper and add it to the skillet in a single layer. Tuck lemon wedges between them. 

Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, turning occasionally, 25 to 30 minutes. 

Transfer the chicken to a platter. 

Add olives and the lemon juice to the skillet. Increase heat to high; boil uncovered to thicken slightly, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Pour over the chicken.
