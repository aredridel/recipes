# Red Lentil Dal with Coconut Milk

2 tbsp olive oil
1 onion diced
1 tbsp grated ginger
1 red chili, de-seeded and finely chopped
1 tomato finely chopped
2 tbsp coriander (cilantro) roots and stalks finely chopped
6 leaves curry
1 tsp yellow mustard seeds
2 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground turmeric
2 cloves garlic finely chopped
1 cup red lentils
3 cups vegetable stock
1 cup coconut milk
salt and pepper to taste
1 lemon juiced

Place a large pot over your smallest burner set to a medium heat. Add the olive oil (you can also use coconut oil or ghee) and the onions, ginger, chilli, tomato and coriander roots. Add a couple of pinches of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are sweet and golden, around 5 minutes.

Add the curry leaves and mustard seeds. When the mustard seeds start to pop add the rest of the spices and garlic. Cook until fragrant. Add the lentils, stock and coconut milk and when it starts bubbling reduce the heat to low.

Let the dal bubble away for 20 minutes or so or until the lentils collapse and the dal becomes beautifully creamy. Taste and adjust the seasonings as necessary and add a squeeze of lemon.
