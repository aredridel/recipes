1 medium onion, diced

50g grated ginger

1 red chili, de-seeded and finely chopped

1 plum tomato, finely chopped

50g coriander, finely chopped, stems and leaves separately

15g yellow mustard seeds

25g ground cumin

15g ground coriander

10g ground cinnamon

15g ground turmeric

4-5 cloves garlic, finely minced

150g red lentils

700ml vegetable stock

250ml coconut milk

salt to taste

1 lemon, juiced



In a large pot over low heat, saute√© the onions, ginger, chilli, tomato and coriander stems. Cook 

Add the curry leaves and mustard seeds. When the mustard seeds start to pop add the rest of the spices and garlic. Cook until fragrant. Add the lentils, stock and coconut milk and when it starts bubbling reduce the heat to low.

Let the dal bubble away for 20 minutes or so or until the lentils collapse and the dal becomes beautifully creamy. Taste and adjust the seasonings as necessary and add a squeeze of lemon.
