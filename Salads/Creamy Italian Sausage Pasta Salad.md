- 500g bite sized pasta, cooked al dente. I prefer campanelle
- 1 can black olives
- 4 italian sausages, (approximately 400g) cooked and sliced into discs
- 200ml mayonaise 
- 100ml of the [sauce from this recipe](../Lemon Beans and Rice.md)



- 10g smoked salt, or 10g salt plus a few drops of liquid smoke.
- 15g smoked paprika, or 10g hot paprika plus 3g chipotle pepper powder
- Juice of 1 lime

Steam or boil the yams in bite size pieces, drain and cool them when they are pleasantly tender but still hold their shape. Add the corn and beans.

Mix the rest into a dressing and coat the rest. Chill.
