Cranberry Orange Relish
=======================

Juice of three oranges
zest of two oranges
A thumb sized amount of fresh ginger, grated as finely as possible.
1.5 packages of fresh cranberries (About 3 cups, measure will vary)
2 tablespoons sugar.
A pinch of salt.

Simmer everything together until the cranberries all burst. Stir to prevent sticking, but itâ€™s not fussy.

Let cool to room temperature and serve.

(Makes a fantastic sauce for pork if you mix 1 cup cranberry sauce, 1 cup chicken broth, 1/4 minced onion or equivalent amount of shallot, 1-2 cloves garlic, and a stalk of rosemary. Salt to taste.)
