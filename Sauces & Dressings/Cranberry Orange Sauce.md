Cranberry Orange Sauce
======================

Delicious as a sauce, and sets up into a pretty solid mass thanks to the pectin in the cranberries. I love it on toast.

Makes a fantastic sauce for pork if you mix 250ml cranberry sauce, 250ml chicken broth, a minced shallot, 1–2 cloves garlic, and a stalk of rosemary.

- Juice of three oranges
- zest of two oranges
- A thumb sized amount of fresh ginger, grated as finely as possible.
- 1 <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2 </sub>US packages of fresh cranberries
- 50g sugar
- 2g salt

Simmer all the ingredients until the cranberries burst. Stir to prevent sticking, but it’s not fussy.

Cool to room temperature and serve.
