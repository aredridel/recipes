Salsa Verde
===========

Roast at 230 °C (450 °F) until brown:

- one large onion, roughly cut
- 500-800 g tomatillos
- 1 head of garlic wrapped in foil

Remove the foil from the garlic and remove the skins. Add the juice of 1 lime
or a 40ml of cider vinegar.

Blend everything until smooth, and salt to taste.
