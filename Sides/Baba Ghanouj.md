Baba Ghanouj
============

Halve 1 eggplant, cover the exposed side with olive oil, and sprinkle with
salt. Roast at 230 °C (450 °F) for 40 minutes. Scrape out of the peel, and
let drain in a sieve.

Add 50-100g tahini and 8 g salt.

Add spices: toasted ground cumin, nigella, sumac, even fenugreek are
excellent.  Garlic is great too.

Blend smooth in a food processor.
