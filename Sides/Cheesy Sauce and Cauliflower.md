# Cheesy Sauce and Cauliflower
- 1 head of cauliflower, broken into small bites
- 40g butter
- 30g flour
- 1 can evaporated milk
- 8 oz sharp cheddar cheese, grated

Preheat the oven to 200 °C (400 °F)

Steam the cauliflower and drain well.

Melt the butter and add the flour to make a roux. Add the evaporated mik and cheese, heating until the cheese melts, and stirring to make a smooth sauce.

Pour the sauce over the cauliflower in a baking dish and bake 20–30 minutes, until starting to brown.

Top with crispy fried onions if you like.
