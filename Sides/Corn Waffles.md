# Corn Waffles (with whole kernel corn) (Gluten free)

For each waffle:

- 1/4 cup corn masa flour (not cornmeal, not corn starch)
- 1/2 cup gluten free flour mix (Bob's Red Mill '1 for 1' is what I use)
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2/3 cup milk
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 can corn kernels, or the kernels from 2 ears of corns, cooked. (Leftover grilled corn makes this a winner)
- A bit of nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

Mix, don't over-mix but it's not gluten flour, it's fine.

Let it sit a few minutes to finish hydrating. The texture should still be a thick liquid, not paste. Thin with milk if needed.

Grease a waffle iron well and cook 8-16 minutes (on my cast iron waffle irons, that's 8 minutes per side)

Take the waffle out when it's decidedly browned. Serve with maple syrup, or a chicken dish.
