# Corn and Cranberry Stuffed Squash

This uses somewhat more North-Eastern North American flavors. It's got a fatty
weight to it, it could be a weekday meal on its own, and the bright flavor of
the cranberries makes the dish come together in a great way. Corn also helps
lean into the North American flavor palette.

This would be excellent served with roasted jerusalem artichokes.

- 2 delicata, acorn, small sugar pumpkin, kabocha, or kuri squash
- 2 onions, chopped (or if you're so lucky: 100 g of fresh ramps. Green onions
  or leek would also be an acceptable substitute.)
- 100 g cranberries, fresh or frozen, chopped
- 100 g corn meal
- 100 g beef, bison, deer, goat or lamb fat
- 20 g brown sugar
- rosemary
- salt

Preheat the oven to 375 Â°F.

Halve and scoop the seeds out of the squash.

Sautee the onions in some of the beef fat until they begin to brown. Melt the
rest of the fat into the pan and add the corn meal, rosemary and cranberries.
Let the dish become a cohesive mash, with no dry spots. It should be barely
able to form a cohesive mound if pressed together. Stir in the sugar and salt
to taste.

Fill the squash with the filling mixture. 

Cover the squash with foil, and bake until the squash is tender. Finish
uncovered if you want a little bit more roasty flavor.
