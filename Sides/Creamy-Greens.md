# Creamy Greens

This is one of those super low effort dishes. It gets a lot of greens into my
husband. It's cream cheese and greens.

- 2 big bunches of greens, or pounds of frozen greens: kale, spinach, mustard,
  turnip, romaine, amaranth, pak choi, yu choi, broccolini, broccoli rabe. It
  doesn't matter. 
- 2 packages of cream cheese. Neufch√¢tel is fine too if you want to reduce the
  fat some.
- Salt.

Clean and stem the greens if needed, then chop roughly. Throw them in a steamer
pot. Drop cream cheese on top. Steam until the greens are thawed if they're
frozen, and tender.

Dump it all into a large bowl and stir to combine. Salt to taste. Toss on
parmesan if you want to get fancy.
