======

I couldn't find bulgur so I made this with whole wheat flour. 

Mince 20 g fresh mint.

Sauteé 1/2 onion in olive oil. Add 250 g ground beef. Spice with sumac, & mint. Salt. Set aside.

Toast cumin and grind. 

Sauteé 250 g more beef, until somewhat browned. Add toasted cumin, and lemon zest. Transfer to a food processor and mix with 100 g whole wheat flour. Pulse, adjust water as needed to make a dough.

Press into palm-sized bowl shapes, fill with the set aside beef, pinch shut.

Fry, or coat with oil and bake at 200 °C (400 °F) for 20 minutes.
