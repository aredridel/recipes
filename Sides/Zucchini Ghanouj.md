Zucchini Ghanouj
================

This is a close relative of the traditional [baba ghanouj](./Baba Ghanouj.md).

Halve and roast 3-4 medium sized zucchini. It's also a great way to use
older, larger zucchini — adjust as needed. Cover the exposed sides with
olive oil, and sprinkle with salt. Roast at 230 °C (450 °F) for 40 minutes
or until brown. Disturb the watery center, and let drain in a sieve.

Add 50-100g tahini and 8 g salt.

Add spices: toasted ground cumin, nigella, sumac, even fenugreek are
excellent. Garlic is great too.

Blend smooth in a food processor.
