Pickled Beets
=============

These are _not_ shelf stable: store them in the fridge, eat them within 6-8
weeks.

2 or more beets, tops and roots cut off, cut into bite size pieces, either
slices or chunks as you prefer.

Barely cover with water in a saucepan, and simmer for 25 minutes. They should
be firm but not difficult to push a fork into.

Scoop out the beets, and pour off half the liquid. Replace that liquid with
vinegar: white distilled is the normal sort.

Add 50 g (1/4 cup) of sugar per 500ml (1 cup) of liquid.

Add 8 g (1 1/2 teaspoon) of salt per 1 cup of liquid.

Add 4-6 cloves and 4-6 allspice, or 10-15 peppercorns and 2-3 cloves of
garlic.

Simmer until the sugar is dissolved, then pour over the beets in a jar and
close the lid. Let cool and then store in the refrigerator.
