# Recipes

I'm putting recipes from my family cookbook here as well as writing down my own recipes with more specificity than I usually do. 

I grew up vegetarian, so there's a lot of meatless or meat-optional meals here. Some of the things my mother put in the cookbook she gave me are, I'm sure, clippings from the Vegetarian Times magazine. In hindsight I had a delicious pan-cultural upbringing but also most of the recipes I grew up with were lightened up on fat, salt and spices. My approach to cooking now uses a lot more of all of those things, and I'm starting to bump up the numbers in those older recipes. On the other hand, what my family did growing up did manage to steer around the blandest, cardboardiest bits of 1980s vegan macrobiotic diet weirdness. Not so many kale salads with tofu dressings, more vaguely "asian" themed dishes, with only one or two ingredients giving a gist of what culture they were derived from. Bridging the gap from there is something I learned to do later.

I'm a huge fan of [Salt Fat Acid Heat](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/) as a theory of cooking, and in general like Samin Nosrat's down-to-earth approach to food. Much of what I cook would make sense in that context. There will be an inordinate number of dishes containing lemon, as it's one of my favorite flavors, and a near-instant source of delicious acidity for foods. I use a lot of spices — I buy in bulk and use them up before they go stale, so there are amounts that many white people in the US would be surprised by and anyone in another century would be ill at ease to afford. I'm a fan of the [theory of spices](https://epicesdecru.com/products/livres/the-golden-rules-of-spices) that [Epices de Cru](https://epicesdecru.com/) advances too. 

In addition, I'm used to cooking for dietary restrictions — I'm married to someone with some health issues that diet helps, and my vegetarian upbringing means I'm used to substituting even for very central parts of recipes. You may be interested in the list of [ingredients I keep on hand](Ingredients.md), as I think it both shows the philosophy I have with cooking a bit and paints a picture of how I cook.
