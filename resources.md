[Tigers and Strawberries](http://www.tigersandstrawberries.com/), a now-ended food blog with excellent tips and techniques centered around asian cuisines, and all around excellent.

[Serious Eats](https://seriouseats.com), especially J. Kenki Lopez-Alt's work tends to be well above average. If I'm unsure of a technique or there are too many conflicting variations of recipes out there to learn something, I start with theirs. I'm rarely disappointed.

[King Arthur Flour's recipes](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes) are excellent for baking, and I hear their hotline is incredibly useful if you have a question you want an expert opinion on.

[This article on the aesthetics of cooking processes](https://aestheticsforbirds.com/2018/02/27/whats-missing-from-cookbook-reviews/) is one I'll be digesting for the next year or more.
